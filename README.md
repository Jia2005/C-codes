# C Programming Stash ðŸ’»

Sup coders! ðŸ¤˜ This is my dump of all the C stuff I had to code for college. Nothing fancy - just the programs that got me through my course without losing my mind.

I threw this together hoping it might save someone else some headaches. 

## Programs Included
- **Math Operations:** Area of different shapes, Matrix equation solving, Matrix row and column summation, Summation of number
- **Number Programs:** Armstrong, Fibonacci, Finding Max and min, Perfect Square, Prime Numbers, nCr
- **Array Handling:** Array Operations, Matrix calculations
- **String Operations:** Palindrome, Vowels
- **Search Algorithms:** Linear Search
- **Function Examples:** Call by Reference, Call by Value
- **Pattern Printing:** Printing different patterns
- **Student Records:** Storing Student Details, Student Details Printing (with proper columns)

## How to use this?
1. Clone the repo or download whatever you need
2. Compile using any C compiler (I used GCC)
3. Run and learn!

```bash
gcc filename.c 
./a.out
```

These are college assignments, so they might not be the most optimized solutions out there. Feel free to improve them!

## Need help?
If you're stuck on something or found a bug, open an issue. I'll try to help when I can, but no promises on timing (adulting is hard ðŸ¥²).
